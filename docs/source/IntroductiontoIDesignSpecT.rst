         IDesignSpecTM (IDS) is a suite of products that improve the
         productivity of FPGA/ASIC, IP/SoC and System Development teams.
         These products encompass an innovative register information
         management system to capture hardware functional specifications
         and addressable register specifications in a single
         "executable" specification. All downstream code and
         documentation for the addressable registers, sequences or
         interrupts can be generated from a single specification. 

         IDS eliminates the inefficiencies around specifications in a
         digital design process and helps reduce the design cost, while
         improving quality and time to market. 

         The key features of IDS enable:

         -  Designers to create correct-by-construction, reusable
            designs, faster.
         -  Verification Engineers to comprehensively and quickly verify
            the registers and memories.
         -  Firmware and device driver teams to generate device drivers
            faster.

         Other features of IDS:

         -  Automates the generation of derived documentation for
            Tech-Pubs, Lab, internal and external customers.
         -  Eliminates inefficiencies in the digital design process.
         -  Prevents errors from entering the system by giving
            appropriate error messages in the document itself. 
         -  Carefully manages the register information and any changes
            throughout the design process. 
         -  Increases the productivity of FPGA/ASIC, SoC and System
            Design teams by auto generation of Register database
            information in the formats desired by the various teams.
         -  Reduces the design cost by reducing iterations due to lack
            of accurate communication between various teams.
